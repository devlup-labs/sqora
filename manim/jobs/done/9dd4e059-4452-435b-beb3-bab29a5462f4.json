It's a fundamental concept in electricity, and very important for your JEE/NEET preparation!\n\nThink of Ohm's Law as a simple relationship that connects three key electrical quantities: **Voltage (V)**, **Current (I)**, and **Resistance (R)**.\n\n---\n\n## What is Ohm's Law?\n\nOhm's Law states that the **current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference (voltage) applied across its ends, provided the physical conditions (like temperature) remain constant.**\n\nLet's break down the terms first:\n\n1.  **Current ($\\text{I}$):** This is the *flow* of electric charge (like water flowing through a pipe). Measured in **Amperes ($\\text{A}$)**.\n2.  **Voltage ($\\text{V}$):** This is the *push* or electrical pressure that makes the charge flow (like the water pressure from a pump). Measured in **Volts ($\\text{V}$)**.\n3.  **Resistance ($\\text{R}$):** This is the *opposition* to the flow of charge (like a narrow or bumpy part in the pipe). Measured in **Ohms ($\\Omega$)**.\n\n### The Mathematical Formula\n\nThe relationship is best summarized by this famous equation:\n\n$$\\text{V} = \\text{I} \\times \\text{R}$$\n\nOr, if you rearrange it:\n\n$$\\text{I} = \\frac{\\text{V}}{\\text{R}}$$\n\nThis means:\n\n1.  If you **increase the Voltage ($\\text{V}$)** across a resistor, the **Current ($\\text{I}$)** flowing through it will **increase** (assuming $\\text{R}$ stays the same).\n2.  If you **increase the Resistance ($\\text{R}$)** in a circuit, the **Current ($\\text{I}$)** flowing through it will **decrease** (assuming $\\text{V}$ stays the same).\n\n---\n\n## Analogy: The Water Pipe System\n\nTo make this concept crystal clear, let's use the water pipe analogy:\n\n| Electrical Term | Water Analogy | Role |\n| :---: | :---: | :--- |\n| **Voltage ($\\text{V}$)** | Water Pressure | The force pushing the water. |\n| **Current ($\\text{I}$)** | Water Flow Rate | How much water passes a point per second. |\n| **Resistance ($\\text{R}$)** | Pipe Obstruction/Narrowness | How hard it is for the water to flow. |\n\n**If you increase the water pressure ($\\text{V}$), more water will flow ($\\text{I}$). If you make the pipe narrower ($\\text{R}$ increases), less water flows ($\\text{I}$ decreases).**\n\n---\n\n## Example Calculation\n\nSuppose you have a simple circuit with a battery and a resistor.\n\n**Given:**\n*   The voltage ($\\text{V}$) supplied by the battery is **12 Volts ($\\text{V}$)**.\n*   The resistor ($\\text{R}$) has a resistance of **4 Ohms ($\\Omega$)**.\n\n**Question:** What is the current ($\\text{I}$) flowing in the circuit?\n\n**Solution:**\nUsing Ohm's Law:\n$$\\text{I} = \\frac{\\text{V}}{\\text{R}}$$\n$$\\text{I} = \\frac{12 \\text{ V}}{4 \\Omega}$$\n$$\\text{I} = 3 \\text{ Amperes (A)}$$\n\nSo, 3 Amperes of current will flow through the resistor.\n\n---\n\n## Key Takeaway for Exams\n\nRemember the relationship $\\text{V} = \\text{IR}$. This simple formula allows you to solve most basic circuit problems involving direct current (DC) components.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions, or if you'd like to practice a few more problems!"}]}
