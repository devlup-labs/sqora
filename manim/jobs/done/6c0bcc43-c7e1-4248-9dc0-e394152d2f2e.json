{"topic": "Chemical Reaction", "response_text": "Moving from Physics back to Chemistry! **Le Chatelier's Principle** is basically the \"Law of Stubbornness\" in Chemistry. \n\nIt tells us how a chemical reaction at **equilibrium** reacts when we try to disturb it.\n\n### The Definition\n> \"If a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in concentration, temperature, or pressure, the system will shift its equilibrium position in a way that tends to **undo or counteract** the effect of the change.\"\n\n**Simple Analogy:** Think of it like a seesaw. If you add weight to one side, the seesaw will move to try and find a new balance. \n\n---\n\n### The 4 Major Factors (High-Yield for JEE/NEET)\n\n#### 1. Concentration ($C$)\n*   **Add more Reactant:** The system wants to get rid of it. It shifts **Forward** (makes more product).\n*   **Add more Product:** The system wants to get rid of it. It shifts **Backward** (makes more reactant).\n*   **Remove Product:** (Common in industries) The system tries to make more. It shifts **Forward**.\n\n#### 2. Pressure ($P$) / Volume ($V$)\n*This only affects reactions involving **Gases**.*\n*   **Increase Pressure:** The system feels \"crowded.\" It shifts toward the side with **fewer moles of gas**.\n*   **Decrease Pressure:** The system feels \"empty.\" It shifts toward the side with **more moles of gas**.\n*   *Note: If moles of gas are equal on both sides ($\\Delta n_g = 0$), pressure has no effect!*\n\n#### 3. Temperature ($T$)\nThis is the only factor that also changes the value of the Equilibrium Constant ($K_{eq}$).\n*   **Exothermic Reaction** (Heat is released): Treating heat as a \"product.\"\n    *   Increase Temp $\\to$ Shifts **Backward**.\n*   **Endothermic Reaction** (Heat is absorbed): Treating heat as a \"reactant.\"\n    *   Increase Temp $\\to$ Shifts **Forward**.\n\n#### 4. Addition of Inert Gas (The Trick Question)\n*   **At Constant Volume:** No effect on equilibrium.\n*   **At Constant Pressure:** The volume increases, so the system shifts to the side with **more moles of gas**.\n\n---\n\n### Classic Example: The Haber Process\nProduction of Ammonia: \n$$N_2(g) + 3H_2(g) \\rightleftharpoons 2NH_3(g) + \\text{Heat}$$\n\nTo get the **maximum yield of Ammonia ($NH_3$)**, how should we shift the equilibrium to the **Forward** direction?\n1.  **Concentration:** Keep adding $N_2$ and $H_2$, and keep removing $NH_3$.\n2.  **Pressure:** The left side has 4 moles $(1+3)$, and the right side has 2 moles. So, **High Pressure** will shift it forward.\n3.  **Temperature:** Since it is Exothermic (+ Heat), we should use **Low Temperature**. (In practice, we use a medium \"optimum\" temp so the reaction isn't too slow).\n\n---\n\n### Important \"Trap\" for Exams:\n**The Catalyst:** \nDoes a catalyst shift the equilibrium? **NO.** \nA catalyst only helps the system reach equilibrium *faster*. it does not change the position of equilibrium or the yield of the products.\n\n**SQORA Study Tip:**\nWhenever you see a Le Chatelier question, first check the **Physical States** (ignore solids and liquids for pressure) and the **$\\Delta H$** (is it $+$ or $-$?). \n\nWould you like to try a practice question on how a change in volume affects a specific reaction?"}
