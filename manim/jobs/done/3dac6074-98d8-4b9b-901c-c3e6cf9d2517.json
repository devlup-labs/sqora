{"topic": "JEE/NEET Lesson", "response_text": "In the world of Physics, **Potential Energy (PE)** is often called \"Stored Energy.\" \n\nWhile **Kinetic Energy** is the energy of **motion**, **Potential Energy** is the energy an object has because of its **position** or **configuration**.\n\nThink of it like a bank account: you\u2019ve stored energy there, and it\u2019s ready to be \"spent\" (converted into motion) whenever you need it!\n\n---\n\n### 1. Gravitational Potential Energy\nThis is the most common type you\u2019ll see in JEE/NEET problems. It is the energy an object possesses because of its height above the ground.\n\n*   **Formula:** $$U = mgh$$\n    *   **$m$**: Mass of the object (kg)\n    *   **$g$**: Acceleration due to gravity ($\\approx 9.8$ or $10 \\text{ m/s}^2$)\n    *   **$h$**: Height from the **Reference Level** (m)\n\n**Important Concept: The Reference Level**\nPotential energy is relative. If you are holding a ball 1 meter above a table, its PE is $mg(1)$. But if that table is on the 10th floor of a building, its PE relative to the ground is much higher. In exams, always decide your \"Zero Level\" first!\n\n---\n\n### 2. Elastic Potential Energy (Springs)\nWhen you compress or stretch a spring, you are doing work against the spring force. That work is stored as Elastic PE.\n\n*   **Formula:** $$U = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$$\n    *   **$k$**: Spring constant (stiffness of the spring)\n    *   **$x$**: Displacement from the mean/natural position (how much you stretched or squashed it).\n\n---\n\n### 3. The JEE/NEET \"Pro\" Perspective\nTo score well, you need to understand the relationship between **Force** and **Potential Energy**:\n\n1.  **Conservative Forces only:** Potential energy is *only* defined for conservative forces (like Gravity, Spring force, and Electrostatic force). It is NOT defined for Friction.\n2.  **The Relation:** Force is the negative gradient of potential energy:\n    $$F = -\\frac{dU}{dx}$$\n    *If you have a graph of $U$ vs $x$, the slope tells you the Force!*\n3.  **Work-Energy Theorem:** Work done by a conservative force is equal to the negative change in potential energy:\n    $$W_c = -\\Delta U = -(U_f - U_i)$$\n\n---\n\n### Real-Life Examples:\n*   **A Bow and Arrow:** When you pull the string back, you are storing **Elastic PE**. When you let go, it turns into **Kinetic Energy** of the arrow.\n*   **Water in a Dam:** Water stored at a height has massive **Gravitational PE**. When it falls, it turns turbines to generate electricity.\n*   **A Compressed Slinky:** It has potential energy waiting to be released.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Check:\nIf you lift a 2kg brick to a height of 5 meters, how much Potential Energy does it gain? (Take $g = 10 \\text{ m/s}^2$)\n\n*   **Calculation:** $U = mgh = 2 \\times 10 \\times 5 = \\mathbf{100 \\text{ Joules}}.$\n\n**What\u2019s next?** We could look at **Electrostatic Potential Energy** (for Class 12th Physics) or the **Law of Conservation of Energy**. Which one would you prefer?"}
